# discordweb

New Version = https://github.com/Emircnyld/discordweb_v1

Simple and useful discord server stats for websites. It looks like LGSL. I used Bootstrap for a good view.

It is my first project at github so your ideas are for important for me.

<h3><strong>Usage</strong></h3>
<li>Open Widget Module for your Discord server</li>
<li>Open Developer Mode for get server id</li>
<li>Create a discord bot for monitor your server</li>
<li>Create a never expire invite link</li>

Now we can start edit files. You should edit 3 areas "Invite Link, Server ID, Bot Token" In normal it is for one server but you can edit it basical. If i get interest i want, i will improve it.
